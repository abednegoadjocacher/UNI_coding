I wrote a progam to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
To know the amount earned after Hosting a programe in the stadium.
Each division of the stadinm has it own fare.
The user is expect to enter the number audience needed for each apartment.
I learnt to implement a simple if condition in a programe with else with else statements.
Also, the amount is made user friendly to ask for the prize.
To know if a number is even or not even.A nested if and else if statements to check grade.
I solve some complex problems relating to a program that allows user to enter value.
